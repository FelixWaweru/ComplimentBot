You are unloved.
Sometimes if you squint really hard you can see your future crumbling around you as time goes on.
Today is the day you finally acheive something great, seeing this tweet.
I fart in your general direction.
Someone laughed at you today and you will never know what it was about.
I turned myself into an asshole Morty, I'm asshole boooooot.
Though they may never admit it, your parents sometimes dislike you strongly.
I have good and bad news. Good news,someday you will die, bad news, we have to attend your funeral.
Nobody likes poop and yet they made an emoji after it. You are emojiless and thus hated more than poop.
